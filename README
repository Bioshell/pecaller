# pecaller

This is software to map and call next generation genomic sequnecing by David J. Cutler, Ph.D. and colleagues.

## Build genome index

* Download the genome fa files. 

For instance, `rsync -avzP rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/ .`
will download all of mm10 into the current working directory.

* Merge all of the fa files into one large fa file.

Use the Perl script `merge_dir_fa.pl` to merge the files, like so `perl ~/software/pecaller/src/merge_dir_fa.pl -d ../mm10_2015-01-25/ -c '1-19,M,X,Y' -o mm10`. 
The intention of the script is to order the index so that the named chromosomes (here, chrs 1-19, M, X, and Y) are in the natural order and after those are placed
any unmapped or alternative chromosome.

* Index the merged fa file.

Use `index_genome` either interactively to index the merged fa file or `index_genome < in.cmds` where `in.cmds` is a file with the following information.

    in.cmds:
    d
    1000
    mm10.fa
    mm10
    n


* mapping `fastq` files
